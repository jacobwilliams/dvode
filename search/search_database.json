var tipuesearch = {"pages":[{"title":" dvode ","text":"dvode Modern Fortran Edition of the DVODE ODE Solver. THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS! Documentation The latest API documentation can be found here . This was generated from the source code using FORD (i.e. by running ford ford.md ). Compiling The library can be compiled with recent versions the Intel Fortran Compiler and GFortran (and presumably any other Fortran compiler that supports modern standards). A fpm.toml file is provided for compiling dvode with the Fortran Package Manager . For example, to build: fpm build --profile release By default, the library is built with double precision ( real64 ) real values. Explicitly specifying the real kind can be done using the following processor flags: Preprocessor flag Kind Number of bytes REAL32 real(kind=real32) 4 REAL64 real(kind=real64) 8 REAL128 real(kind=real128) 16 For example, to build a single precision version of the library, use: fpm build --profile release --flag \"-DREAL32\" To run the unit tests: fpm test --profile release To use dvode within your fpm project, add the following to your fpm.toml file: [dependencies] dvode = { git = \"https://github.com/jacobwilliams/dvode.git\" } or, to use a specific version: [dependencies] dvode = { git = \"https://github.com/jacobwilliams/dvode.git\" , tag = \"1.0.0\" } The library requires some BLAS routines, which are included. However, the user may also choose to link to an external BLAS library. This can be done by using the HAS_BLAS compiler directive. For example: fpm build --compiler gfortran --flag \"-DHAS_BLAS -lblas\" However, note that an external BLAS can only be used if the library is compiled with double precision ( real64 ) reals.

Summary of usage. communication between the user and the dvode package, for normal\n situations, is summarized here.  this summary describes only a subset\n of the full set of options available.  see the full description under dvode for details, including optional communication, nonstandard\n options,  and instructions for special situations. first provide a subroutine f of the form f_func :\n    which supplies the vector function f by loading ydot(i) with f(i). next determine (or guess) whether or not the problem is stiff.\n    stiffness occurs when the jacobian matrix df/dy has an eigenvalue\n    whose real part is negative and large in magnitude, compared to the\n    reciprocal of the t span of interest.  if the problem is nonstiff,\n    use a method flag mf = 10.  if it is stiff, there are four standard\n    choices for mf (21, 22, 24, 25), and dvode requires the jacobian\n    matrix in some form.  in these cases (mf > 0), dvode will use a\n    saved copy of the jacobian matrix.  if this is undesirable because of\n    storage limitations, set mf to the corresponding negative value\n    (-21, -22, -24, -25).  (see full description of mf below.)\n    the jacobian matrix is regarded either as full (mf = 21 or 22),\n    or banded (mf = 24 or 25).  in the banded case, dvode requires two\n    half-bandwidth parameters ml and mu.  these are, respectively, the\n    widths of the lower and upper parts of the band, excluding the main\n    diagonal.  thus the band consists of the locations (i,j) with\n    i-ml <= j <= i+mu, and the full bandwidth is ml+mu+1. if the problem is stiff, you are encouraged to supply the jacobian\n    directly (mf = 21 or 24), but if this is not feasible, dvode will\n    compute it internally by difference quotients (mf = 22 or 25).\n    if you are supplying the jacobian, provide a subroutine of the form f_jac which supplies df/dy by loading pd as follows (in either case, only nonzero elements need be loaded): for a full jacobian (mf = 21), load pd(i,j) with df(i)/dy(j),\n    the partial derivative of f(i) with respect to y(j).  (ignore the\n    ml and mu arguments in this case.) for a banded jacobian (mf = 24), load pd(i-j+mu+1,j) with\n    df(i)/dy(j), i.e. load the diagonal lines of df/dy into the rows of\n    pd from the top down. write a main program which calls subroutine dvode once for\n    each point at which answers are desired.  this should also provide\n    for possible use of logical unit 6 for output of error messages\n    by dvode.  on the first call to dvode, supply arguments as follows: f      = name of subroutine for right-hand side vector f. jac    = name of subroutine for jacobian matrix (mf = 21 or 24). neq    = number of first order odes. y      = array of initial values, of length neq. t      = the initial value of the independent variable. tout   = first point where output is desired (/= t). itol   = 1 or 2 according as atol (below) is a scalar or array. rtol   = relative tolerance parameter. atol   = absolute tolerance parameter. itask  = 1 for normal computation of output values of y at t = tout. istate = integer flag (input and output).  set istate = 1. iopt   = 0 to indicate no optional input used. rwork  = real work array lrw    = declared length of rwork. iwork  = integer work array. liw    = declared length of iwork (in user's dimension statement). mf     = method flag. the output from the first call (or any call) is: y = array of computed values of y(t) vector. t = corresponding value of independent variable (normally tout). istate = 2  if dvode was successful, negative otherwise. -1 means excess work done on this call. (perhaps wrong mf.) -2 means excess accuracy requested. (tolerances too small.) -3 means illegal input detected. (see printed message.) -4 means repeated error test failures. (check all input.) -5 means repeated convergence failures. (perhaps bad\n     jacobian supplied or wrong choice of mf or tolerances.) -6 means error weight became zero during problem. (solution\n     component i vanished, and atol or atol(i) = 0.) to continue the integration after a successful return, simply\n    reset tout and call dvode again.  no other parameters need be reset.

Note the legality of input parameters will be thoroughly checked on the\n      initial call for the problem, but not checked thereafter unless a\n      change in input parameters is flagged by istate = 3 in the input. Note the work arrays must not be altered between calls to dvode for the same problem, except possibly for the conditional and\n      optional input, and except for the last 3*neq words of rwork .\n      the latter space is used for internal scratch space, and so is\n      available for use by the user outside dvode between calls, if\n      desired (but not for use by f or jac ). Type Bound dvode_t Arguments Type Intent Optional Attributes Name class( dvode_t ), intent(inout) :: me integer, intent(in) :: neq the size of the ode system (number of first order\nordinary differential equations). neq may not be increased during the problem, but\ncan be decreased (with istate = 3 in the input). real(kind=wp), intent(inout) :: y (*) a real array for the vector of dependent variables, of\nlength neq or more.  used for both input and output on the\nfirst call ( istate = 1 ), and only for output on other calls.\non the first call, y must contain the vector of initial\nvalues.  in the output, y contains the computed solution\nevaluated at t .  if desired, the y array may be used\nfor other purposes between calls to the solver. this array is passed as the y argument in all calls to f and jac . real(kind=wp), intent(inout) :: t the independent variable.  in the input, t is used only on\nthe first call, as the initial point of the integration.\nin the output, after each call, t is the value at which a\ncomputed solution y is evaluated (usually the same as tout ).\non an error return, t is the farthest point reached. real(kind=wp), intent(in) :: tout the next value of t at which a computed solution is desired. when starting the problem ( istate = 1 ), tout may be equal\nto t for one call, then should /= t for the next call.\nfor the initial t , an input value of tout /= t is used\nin order to determine the direction of the integration\n(i.e. the algebraic sign of the step sizes) and the rough\nscale of the problem.  integration in either direction\n(forward or backward in t ) is permitted. if itask = 2 or 5 (one-step modes), tout is ignored after\nthe first call (i.e. the first call with tout /= t ).\notherwise, tout is required on every call. if itask = 1, 3, or 4 , the values of tout need not be\nmonotone, but a value of tout which backs up is limited\nto the current internal t interval, whose endpoints are tcur - hu and tcur .  (see optional output, below, for tcur and hu .) integer, intent(in) :: itol an indicator for the type of error control.\n1 or 2 according as atol is a scalar or array.\nsee description under atol . real(kind=wp), intent(in) :: rtol (*) a relative error tolerance parameter, either a scalar or\nan array of length neq .  see description under atol . real(kind=wp), intent(in) :: atol (*) an absolute error tolerance parameter, either a scalar or\n an array of length neq . the input parameters itol , rtol , and atol determine\n the error control performed by the solver.  the solver will\n control the vector e = (e(i)) of estimated local errors\n in y , according to an inequality of the form rms-norm of ( e(i)/ewt(i) )   <=   1,\n where  ewt(i) = rtol(i)*abs(y(i)) + atol(i), and the rms-norm (root-mean-square norm) here is rms-norm(v) = sqrt(sum v(i)**2 / neq) .  here ewt = (ewt(i)) is a vector of weights which must always be positive, and\n the values of rtol and atol should all be non-negative.\n the following table gives the types (scalar/array) of rtol and atol , and the corresponding form of ewt(i) . itol    rtol       atol          ewt(i)\n     1     scalar     scalar     rtol*abs(y(i)) + atol\n     2     scalar     array      rtol*abs(y(i)) + atol(i)\n     3     array      scalar     rtol(i)*abs(y(i)) + atol\n     4     array      array      rtol(i)*abs(y(i)) + atol(i) when either of these parameters is a scalar, it need not\n be dimensioned in the user's calling program. if none of the above choices (with itol , rtol , and atol fixed throughout the problem) is suitable, more general\n error controls can be obtained by substituting\n user-supplied routines for the setting of ewt and/or for\n the norm calculation. if global errors are to be estimated by making a repeated\n run on the same problem with smaller tolerances, then all\n components of rtol and atol (i.e. of ewt ) should be scaled\n down uniformly. use rtol = 0.0 for pure absolute error control, and\n use atol = 0.0 (or atol(i) = 0.0 ) for pure relative error\n control.  caution: actual (global) errors may exceed these\n local tolerances, so choose them conservatively. integer, intent(in) :: itask an index specifying the task to be performed.\ninput only.  itask has the following values and meanings: 1  means normal computation of output values of y(t) at\n      t = tout (by overshooting and interpolating). 2  means take one step only and return. 3  means stop at the first internal mesh point at or\n     beyond t = tout and return. 4  means normal computation of output values of y(t) at\n     t = tout but without overshooting t = tcrit.\n     tcrit must be input as rwork(1).  tcrit may be equal to\n     or beyond tout, but not behind it in the direction of\n     integration.  this option is useful if the problem\n     has a singularity at or beyond t = tcrit. 5  means take one step, without passing tcrit, and return.\n     tcrit must be input as rwork(1). note:  if itask = 4 or 5 and the solver reaches tcrit\n(within roundoff), it will return t = tcrit (exactly) to\nindicate this (unless itask = 4 and tout comes before tcrit,\nin which case answers at t = tout are returned first). integer, intent(inout) :: istate an index used for input and output to specify the\nthe state of the calculation. in the input, the values of istate are as follows: means this is the first call for the problem\n     (initializations will be done).  see note below. means this is not the first call, and the calculation\n     is to continue normally, with no change in any input\n     parameters except possibly tout and itask.\n     (if itol, rtol, and/or atol are changed between calls\n     with istate = 2, the new values will be used but not\n     tested for legality.) means this is not the first call, and the\n     calculation is to continue normally, but with\n     a change in input parameters other than\n     tout and itask.  changes are allowed in\n     neq, itol, rtol, atol, iopt, lrw, liw, mf, ml, mu,\n     and any of the optional input except h0.\n     (see iwork description for ml and mu.) note:  a preliminary call with tout = t is not counted\nas a first call here, as no initialization or checking of\ninput is done.  (such a call is sometimes useful to include\nthe initial conditions in the output.)\nthus the first call for which tout /= t requires\nistate = 1 in the input. in the output, istate has the following values and meanings: 1  means nothing was done, as tout was equal to t with\n     istate = 1 in the input. 2  means the integration was performed successfully. -1  means an excessive amount of work (more than mxstep\n      steps) was done on this call, before completing the\n      requested task, but the integration was otherwise\n      successful as far as t.  (mxstep is an optional input\n      and is normally 500.)  to continue, the user may\n      simply reset istate to a value > 1 and call again.\n      (the excess work step counter will be reset to 0.)\n      in addition, the user may increase mxstep to avoid\n      this error return.  (see optional input below.) -2  means too much accuracy was requested for the precision\n      of the machine being used.  this was detected before\n      completing the requested task, but the integration\n      was successful as far as t.  to continue, the tolerance\n      parameters must be reset, and istate must be set\n      to 3.  the optional output tolsf may be used for this\n      purpose.  (note: if this condition is detected before\n      taking any steps, then an illegal input return\n      (istate = -3) occurs instead.) -3  means illegal input was detected, before taking any\n      integration steps.  see written message for details.\n      note:  if the solver detects an infinite loop of calls\n      to the solver with illegal input, it will cause\n      the run to stop. -4  means there were repeated error test failures on\n      one attempted step, before completing the requested\n      task, but the integration was successful as far as t.\n      the problem may have a singularity, or the input\n      may be inappropriate. -5  means there were repeated convergence test failures on\n      one attempted step, before completing the requested\n      task, but the integration was successful as far as t.\n      this may be caused by an inaccurate jacobian matrix,\n      if one is being used. -6  means ewt(i) became zero for some i during the\n      integration.  pure relative error control (atol(i)=0.0)\n      was requested on a variable which has now vanished.\n      the integration was successful as far as t. note:  since the normal output value of istate is 2,\nit does not need to be reset for normal continuation.\nalso, since a negative input value of istate will be\nregarded as illegal, a negative output value requires the\nuser to change it, and possibly other input, before\ncalling the solver again. integer, intent(in) :: iopt an integer flag to specify whether or not any optional\ninput is being used on this call.\nthe optional input is listed separately below. iopt = 0 means no optional input is being used.\n   default values will be used in all cases. iopt = 1 means optional input is being used. real(kind=wp) :: rwork (lrw) a real working array.\nthe length of rwork must be at least 20 + nyh*(maxord + 1) + 3*neq + lwm where: nyh = the initial value of neq, maxord = 12 (if meth = 1) or 5 (if meth = 2) (unless a\n              smaller value is given as an optional input), lwm = length of work space for matrix-related data: lwm = 0 if miter = 0, lwm = 2*neq**2 + 2 if miter = 1 or 2, and mf >0, lwm = neq**2 + 2 if miter = 1 or 2, and mf <0, lwm = neq + 2 if miter = 3, lwm = (3*ml+2*mu+2)*neq + 2 if miter = 4 or 5, and mf >0, lwm = (2*ml+mu+1)*neq + 2 if miter = 4 or 5, and mf <0. (see the mf description for meth and miter .)\nthus if maxord has its default value and neq is constant,\nthis length is: 20 + 16*neq for mf = 10, 22 + 16*neq + 2*neq**2 for mf = 11 or 12, 22 + 16*neq + neq**2 for mf = -11 or -12, 22 + 17*neq for mf = 13, 22 + 18*neq + (3*ml+2*mu)*neq for mf = 14 or 15, 22 + 17*neq + (2*ml+mu)*neq for mf = -14 or -15, 20 +  9*neq for mf = 20, 22 +  9*neq + 2*neq**2 for mf = 21 or 22, 22 +  9*neq + neq**2 for mf = -21 or -22, 22 + 10*neq for mf = 23, 22 + 11*neq + (3*ml+2*mu)*neq for mf = 24 or 25. 22 + 10*neq + (2*ml+mu)*neq for mf = -24 or -25. the first 20 words of rwork are reserved for conditional\nand optional input and optional output. rwork can also used for conditional and\noptional input and optional output. the following word in rwork is a conditional input: rwork(1) = tcrit = critical value of t which the solver\n   is not to overshoot.  required if itask is\n   4 or 5, and ignored otherwise.  (see itask .)

(the excess work step counter will be reset to 0.) !!       in addition, the user may increase mxstep to avoid !!       this error return.  (see optional input below.) !!  * -2  means too much accuracy was requested for the precision !!       of the machine being used.  this was detected before !!       completing the requested task, but the integration !!       was successful as far as t.  to continue, the tolerance !!       parameters must be reset, and istate must be set !!       to 3.  the optional output tolsf may be used for this !!       purpose.

(istate = -3) occurs instead.) !!  * -3  means illegal input was detected, before taking any !!       integration steps.  see written message for details. !!       note:  if the solver detects an infinite loop of calls !!       to the solver with illegal input, it will cause !!       the run to stop. !!  * -4  means there were repeated error test failures on !!       one attempted step, before completing the requested !!       task, but the integration was successful as far as t. !!       the problem may have a singularity, or the input !!       may be inappropriate. !!  * -5  means there were repeated convergence test failures on !!       one attempted step, before completing the requested !!       task, but the integration was successful as far as t. !!       this may be caused by an inaccurate jacobian matrix, !!       if one is being used. !!  * -6  means ewt(i) became zero for some i during the !!       integration.  pure relative error control (atol(i)=0.0) !!       was requested on a variable which has now vanished. !!       the integration was successful as far as t. !! !! note:  since the normal output value of istate is 2, !! it does not need to be reset for normal continuation. !! also, since a negative input value of istate will be !! regarded as illegal, a negative output value requires the !! user to change it, and possibly other input, before !! calling the solver again. integer , intent ( in ) :: iopt !! an integer flag to specify whether or not any optional !! input is being used on this call. !! the optional input is listed separately below. !! !!  * iopt = 0 means no optional input is being used. !!    default values will be used in all cases. !!  * iopt = 1 means optional input is being used. integer , intent ( in ) :: liw !! the length of the array iwork, as declared by the user. !! (this will be checked by the solver.) integer :: iwork ( liw ) !! an integer work array.  the length of iwork must be at least: !! !!  * `30`        if miter = 0 or 3 (mf = 10, 13, 20, 23), or !!  * `30 + neq`  otherwise (abs(mf) = 11,12,14,15,21,22,24,25). !! !! the first 30 words of `iwork` are reserved for conditional and !! optional input and optional output. !! !! the following 2 words in `iwork` are conditional input: !! !!  * `iwork(1) = ml` !!  * `iwork(2) = mu` !! !! these are the lower and upper !! half-bandwidths, respectively, of the !! banded jacobian, excluding the main diagonal. !! the band is defined by the matrix locations !! `(i,j)` with `i-ml <= j <= i+mu`.  `ml` and `mu` !! must satisfy  `0 <=  ml,mu  <= neq-1`. !! these are required if `miter` is 4 or 5, and !! ignored otherwise.  `ml` and `mu` may in fact be !! the band parameters for a matrix to which !! `df/dy` is only approximately equal. !! !! The following optional input requires `iopt = 1`, and in that !! case all of this input is examined.  a value of zero for any !! of these optional input variables will cause the default value to be !! used.  thus to use a subset of the optional input, simply preload !! locations 5 to 10 in `iwork` to 0, and !! then set those of interest to nonzero values. !! !!  * `iwork(5) = maxord` = the maximum order to be allowed.  the default !!    value is 12 if `meth = 1`, and 5 if `meth = 2`. !!    if `maxord` exceeds the default value, it will !!    be reduced to the default value. !!    if `maxord` is changed during the problem, it may !!    cause the current order to be reduced. !! !!  * `iwork(6) = mxstep` = maximum number of (internally defined) steps !!    allowed during one call to the solver. !!    the default value is 500. !! !!  * `iwork(7) = mxhnil` = maximum number of messages printed (per problem) !!    warning that `t + h = t` on a step (`h` = step size). !!    this must be positive to result in a non-default !!    value.  the default value is 10. !! !! as optional additional output from dvode, the variables listed !! below are quantities related to the performance of dvode !! which are available to the user. !! except where stated otherwise, all of this output is defined !! on any successful return from dvode, and on any return with !! istate = -1, -2, -4, -5, or -6.  on an illegal input return !! (istate = -3), they will be unchanged from their existing values !! (if any), except possibly for `lenrw`, and `leniw`. !! on any error return, output relevant to the error will be defined, !! as noted below: !! !!  * `iwork(11) = nst` = the number of steps taken for the problem so far. !!  * `iwork(12) = nfe` = the number of f evaluations for the problem so far. !!  * `iwork(13) = nje` = the number of jacobian evaluations so far. !!  * `iwork(14) = nqu` = the method order last used (successfully). !!  * `iwork(15) = nqcur` = the order to be attempted on the next step. !!  * `iwork(16) = imxer` = the index of the component of largest magnitude in !!    the weighted local error vector ( e(i)/ewt(i) ), !!    on an error return with istate = -4 or -5. !!  * `iwork(17) = lenrw` = the length of rwork actually required. !!    this is defined on normal returns and on an illegal !!    input return for insufficient storage. !!  * `iwork(18) = leniw` = the length of iwork actually required. !!     this is defined on normal returns and on an illegal !!     input return for insufficient storage. !!  * `iwork(19) = nlu` = the number of matrix lu decompositions so far. !!  * `iwork(20) = nni` = the number of nonlinear (newton) iterations so far. !!  * `iwork(21) = ncfn` = the number of convergence failures of the nonlinear !!    solver so far. !!  * `iwork(22) = netf` = the number of error test failures of the integrator !!    so far. integer , intent ( in ) :: mf !! method flag.  standard values are: !! !!  * 10 for nonstiff (adams) method, no jacobian used. !!  * 21 for stiff (bdf) method, user-supplied full jacobian. !!  * 22 for stiff method, internally generated full jacobian. !!  * 24 for stiff method, user-supplied banded jacobian. !!  * 25 for stiff method, internally generated banded jacobian. !! !! the complete set of legal values of !! mf are 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, !! -11, -12, -14, -15, -21, -22, -24, -25. !! !! `mf` is a signed two-digit integer, `mf = jsv*(10*meth + miter)` !! !! `jsv = sign(mf)` indicates the jacobian-saving strategy: !! !!  * jsv =  1 means a copy of the jacobian is saved for reuse !!           in the corrector iteration algorithm. !!  * jsv = -1 means a copy of the jacobian is not saved !!          (valid only for miter = 1, 2, 4, or 5). !! !! `meth` indicates the basic linear multistep method: !! !!  * meth = 1 means the implicit adams method. !!  * meth = 2 means the method based on backward !!           differentiation formulas (bdf-s). !! !! `miter` indicates the corrector iteration method: !! !!  * miter = 0 means functional iteration (no jacobian matrix !!    is involved). !!  * miter = 1 means chord iteration with a user-supplied !!    full (neq by neq) jacobian. !!  * miter = 2 means chord iteration with an internally !!    generated (difference quotient) full jacobian !!    (using neq extra calls to f per df/dy value). !!  * miter = 3 means chord iteration with an internally !!    generated diagonal jacobian approximation !!    (using 1 extra call to f per df/dy evaluation). !!  * miter = 4 means chord iteration with a user-supplied !!    banded jacobian. !!  * miter = 5 means chord iteration with an internally !!    generated banded jacobian (using ml+mu+1 extra !!    calls to f per df/dy evaluation). !! !! if miter = 1 or 4, the user must supply a subroutine `jac` !!

Main DVODE class. ! !### Summary of usage. ! ! communication between the user and the dvode package, for normal ! situations, is summarized here.  this summary describes only a subset ! of the full set of options available.  see the full description under ! [[dvode]] for details, including optional communication, nonstandard ! options,  and instructions for special situations. ! ! 1. first provide a subroutine `f` of the form [[f_func]]: !    which supplies the vector function f by loading ydot(i) with f(i). ! ! 2. next determine (or guess) whether or not the problem is stiff. !    stiffness occurs when the jacobian matrix df/dy has an eigenvalue !    whose real part is negative and large in magnitude, compared to the !    reciprocal of the t span of interest.  if the problem is nonstiff, !    use a method flag mf = 10.  if it is stiff, there are four standard !    choices for mf (21, 22, 24, 25), and dvode requires the jacobian !    matrix in some form.  in these cases (mf > 0), dvode will use a !    saved copy of the jacobian matrix.  if this is undesirable because of !    storage limitations, set mf to the corresponding negative value !    (-21, -22, -24, -25).  (see full description of mf below.) !    the jacobian matrix is regarded either as full (mf = 21 or 22), !    or banded (mf = 24 or 25).  in the banded case, dvode requires two !    half-bandwidth parameters ml and mu.  these are, respectively, the !    widths of the lower and upper parts of the band, excluding the main !    diagonal.  thus the band consists of the locations (i,j) with !    i-ml <= j <= i+mu, and the full bandwidth is ml+mu+1. ! ! 3. if the problem is stiff, you are encouraged to supply the jacobian !    directly (mf = 21 or 24), but if this is not feasible, dvode will !    compute it internally by difference quotients (mf = 22 or 25). !    if you are supplying the jacobian, provide a subroutine of the form [[f_jac]] !    which supplies df/dy by loading pd as follows (in either case, only nonzero elements need be loaded): ! !      * for a full jacobian (mf = 21), load pd(i,j) with df(i)/dy(j), !        the partial derivative of f(i) with respect to y(j).  (ignore the !        ml and mu arguments in this case.) !      * for a banded jacobian (mf = 24), load pd(i-j+mu+1,j) with !        df(i)/dy(j), i.e. load the diagonal lines of df/dy into the rows of !        pd from the top down. ! ! 4. write a main program which calls subroutine dvode once for !    each point at which answers are desired.  this should also provide !    for possible use of logical unit 6 for output of error messages !    by dvode.  on the first call to dvode, supply arguments as follows: ! !      * f      = name of subroutine for right-hand side vector f. !      * jac    = name of subroutine for jacobian matrix (mf = 21 or 24). !      * neq    = number of first order odes. !      * y      = array of initial values, of length neq. !      * t      = the initial value of the independent variable. !      * tout   = first point where output is desired (/= t). !      * itol   = 1 or 2 according as atol (below) is a scalar or array. !      * rtol   = relative tolerance parameter. !      * atol   = absolute tolerance parameter. !      * itask  = 1 for normal computation of output values of y at t = tout. !      * istate = integer flag (input and output).  set istate = 1. !      * iopt   = 0 to indicate no optional input used. !      * rwork  = real work array !      * lrw    = declared length of rwork. !      * iwork  = integer work array. !      * liw    = declared length of iwork (in user's dimension statement). !      * mf     = method flag. ! ! 5. the output from the first call (or any call) is: !    * y = array of computed values of y(t) vector. !    * t = corresponding value of independent variable (normally tout). !    * istate = 2  if dvode was successful, negative otherwise. !        * -1 means excess work done on this call. (perhaps wrong mf.) !        * -2 means excess accuracy requested. (tolerances too small.) !        * -3 means illegal input detected. (see printed message.) !        * -4 means repeated error test failures. (check all input.) !        * -5 means repeated convergence failures. (perhaps bad !             jacobian supplied or wrong choice of mf or tolerances.) !        * -6 means error weight became zero during problem. (solution !             component i vanished, and atol or atol(i) = 0.) ! ! 6. to continue the integration after a successful return, simply !    reset tout and call [[dvode]] again.  no other parameters need be reset. ! !### Other routines callable ! ! the following are optional calls which the user may make to ! gain additional capabilities in conjunction with dvode. !

Set the function pointers. This must be called before [[dvode]] is called. ! !### optionally replaceable solver routines ! !  The two routines (`dewset` and `dvnorm`) relate to the measurement of errors. !  either routine can be replaced by a user-supplied version, if desired. !  however, since such a replacement may have a major impact on performance, !  it should be done only when absolutely necessary, and only with great caution. !  (note: the means by which the package version of a routine is !  superseded by the user's version may be system-dependent.) !  If not changed by the users, the defaults are used: ! !   * [[dewset_default]] !   * [[dvnorm_default]] subroutine initialize ( me , f , jac , dewset , dvnorm ) implicit none class ( dvode_t ), intent ( inout ) :: me procedure ( f_func ) :: f !! the name of the user-supplied subroutine defining the !! ode system.  the system must be put in the first-order !! form dy/dt = f(t,y), where f is a vector-valued function !! of the scalar t and the vector y.  subroutine f is to !! compute the function f.  it is to have the form !!      subroutine f (neq, t, y, ydot) !!      real(wp) t, y(neq), ydot(neq) !! where neq, t, and y are input, and the array ydot = f(t,y) !! is output.  y and ydot are arrays of length neq. !! subroutine f should not alter y(1),...,y(neq). !! f must be declared external in the calling program. !! !! if quantities computed in the f routine are needed !! externally to dvode, an extra call to f should be made !! for this purpose, for consistent and accurate results. !! if only the derivative dy/dt is needed, use [[dvindy]] instead. procedure ( f_jac ), optional :: jac !! the name of the user-supplied routine (miter = 1 or 4) to !! compute the jacobian matrix, df/dy, as a function of !! the scalar t and the vector y.  it is to have the form [[f_jac]], !! where neq, t, y, ml, mu, and nrowpd are input and the array !! pd is to be loaded with partial derivatives (elements of the !! jacobian matrix) in the output.  pd must be given a first !! dimension of nrowpd.  t and y have the same meaning as in !! subroutine f. !! !!  * in the full matrix case (miter = 1), ml and mu are !!    ignored, and the jacobian is to be loaded into pd in !!    columnwise manner, with df(i)/dy(j) loaded into pd(i,j). !! !!  * in the band matrix case (miter = 4), the elements !!    within the band are to be loaded into pd in columnwise !!    manner, with diagonal lines of df/dy loaded into the rows !!    of pd. thus df(i)/dy(j) is to be loaded into pd(i-j+mu+1,j). !!    ml and mu are the half-bandwidth parameters. (see iwork). !!    the locations in pd in the two triangular areas which !!    correspond to nonexistent matrix elements can be ignored !!    or loaded arbitrarily, as they are overwritten by dvode. !! !! jac need not provide df/dy exactly.  a crude !! approximation (possibly with a smaller bandwidth) will do. !! !! in either case, pd is preset to zero by the solver, !! so that only the nonzero elements need be loaded by jac. !! each call to jac is preceded by a call to f with the same !! arguments neq, t, and y.  thus to gain some efficiency, !! intermediate quantities shared by both calculations may be !! saved in a user common block by f and not recomputed by jac, !! if desired.  also, jac may alter the y array, if desired. !! jac must be declared external in the calling program. procedure ( f_dewset ), optional :: dewset !! the following subroutine is called just before each internal !! integration step, and sets the array of error weights, ewt, as !! described under itol/rtol/atol above: !! `subroutine dewset (neq, itol, rtol, atol, ycur, ewt)` !! where neq, itol, rtol, and atol are as in the [[dvode]] call sequence, !! ycur contains the current dependent variable vector, and !! ewt is the array of weights set by dewset. !! !! if the user supplies this subroutine, it must return in ewt(i) !! (i = 1,...,neq) a positive quantity suitable for comparison with !! errors in y(i).  the ewt array returned by dewset is passed to the !! dvnorm routine (see below.), and also used by dvode in the computation !! of the optional output imxer, the diagonal jacobian approximation, !! and the increments for difference quotient jacobians. !! !! in the user-supplied version of dewset, it may be desirable to use !! the current values of derivatives of y.  derivatives up to order nq !! are available from the history array yh, described above under !! optional output.  in dewset, yh is identical to the ycur array, !! extended to nq + 1 columns with a column length of nyh and scale !! factors of h**j/factorial(j).  on the first call for the problem, !! given by nst = 0, nq is 1 and h is temporarily set to 1.0. !! nyh is the initial value of neq.  the quantities nq, h, and nst !! can be obtained by including in dewset the statements: !!```fortran !!  type(dvode_data_t) :: sav !!  call me%dvsrco(sav,job=1) !!  nq = sav%nq !!  h = sav%h !!  nst = sav%nst !!``` !! thus, for example, the current value of dy/dt can be obtained as !! `ycur(nyh+i)/h  (i=1,...,neq)`  (and the division by h is !! unnecessary when nst = 0). procedure ( f_dvnorm ), optional :: dvnorm !! the following is a real function routine which computes the weighted !! root-mean-square norm of a vector v: !! `d = dvnorm (n, v, w)` !! where: !! !!   * n = the length of the vector, !!   * v = real array of length n containing the vector, !!   * w = real array of length n containing weights, !!   * d = `sqrt( (1/n) * sum(v(i)*w(i))**2 )`. !! !! dvnorm is called with n = neq and with w(i) = 1.0/ewt(i), where !! ewt is as set by subroutine dewset. !! !! if the user supplies this function, it should return a non-negative !! value of dvnorm suitable for use in the error control in dvode. !! none of the arguments should be altered by dvnorm. !! for example, a user-supplied dvnorm routine might: !! !!   * substitute a max-norm of (v(i)*w(i)) for the rms-norm, or !!   * ignore some components of v in the norm, with the effect of !!     suppressing the error control on those components of y. me % f => f if ( present ( jac )) then me % jac => jac else me % jac => null () end if if ( present ( dewset )) then me % dewset => dewset else me % dewset => dewset_default end if if ( present ( dvnorm )) then me % dvnorm => dvnorm else me % dvnorm => dvnorm_default end if end subroutine initialize !***************************************************************************************** !***************************************************************************************** !> !

(initializations will be done).  see note below. !!  2.  means this is not the first call, and the calculation !!      is to continue normally, with no change in any input !!      parameters except possibly tout and itask. !!      (if itol, rtol, and/or atol are changed between calls !!      with istate = 2, the new values will be used but not !!      tested for legality.) !!  3.  means this is not the first call, and the !!      calculation is to continue normally, but with !!      a change in input parameters other than !!      tout and itask.  changes are allowed in !!      neq, itol, rtol, atol, iopt, lrw, liw, mf, ml, mu, !!      and any of the optional input except h0. !!      (see iwork description for ml and mu.) !! !! note:  a preliminary call with tout = t is not counted !! as a first call here, as no initialization or checking of !! input is done.  (such a call is sometimes useful to include !! the initial conditions in the output.) !! thus the first call for which tout /= t requires !! istate = 1 in the input. !! !! in the output, istate has the following values and meanings: !! !!  * 1  means nothing was done, as tout was equal to t with !!      istate = 1 in the input. !!  * 2  means the integration was performed successfully. !!  * -1  means an excessive amount of work (more than mxstep !!       steps) was done on this call, before completing the !!       requested task, but the integration was otherwise !!       successful as far as t.  (mxstep is an optional input !!       and is normally 500.)  to continue, the user may !!       simply reset istate to a value > 1 and call again. !!       (the excess work step counter will be reset to 0.) !!       in addition, the user may increase mxstep to avoid !!       this error return.  (see optional input below.) !!  * -2  means too much accuracy was requested for the precision !!       of the machine being used.  this was detected before !!       completing the requested task, but the integration !!       was successful as far as t.  to continue, the tolerance !!       parameters must be reset, and istate must be set !!       to 3.  the optional output tolsf may be used for this !!       purpose.  (note: if this condition is detected before !!       taking any steps, then an illegal input return !!       (istate = -3) occurs instead.) !!  * -3  means illegal input was detected, before taking any !!       integration steps.  see written message for details. !!       note:  if the solver detects an infinite loop of calls !!       to the solver with illegal input, it will cause !!       the run to stop. !!  * -4  means there were repeated error test failures on !!       one attempted step, before completing the requested !!       task, but the integration was successful as far as t. !!       the problem may have a singularity, or the input !!       may be inappropriate. !!  * -5  means there were repeated convergence test failures on !!       one attempted step, before completing the requested !!       task, but the integration was successful as far as t. !!       this may be caused by an inaccurate jacobian matrix, !!       if one is being used. !!  * -6  means ewt(i) became zero for some i during the !!       integration.  pure relative error control (atol(i)=0.0) !!       was requested on a variable which has now vanished. !!       the integration was successful as far as t. !! !! note:  since the normal output value of istate is 2, !! it does not need to be reset for normal continuation. !! also, since a negative input value of istate will be !! regarded as illegal, a negative output value requires the !! user to change it, and possibly other input, before !! calling the solver again. integer , intent ( in ) :: iopt !! an integer flag to specify whether or not any optional !! input is being used on this call. !! the optional input is listed separately below. !! !!  * iopt = 0 means no optional input is being used. !!    default values will be used in all cases. !!  * iopt = 1 means optional input is being used. integer , intent ( in ) :: liw !! the length of the array iwork, as declared by the user. !!

The following optional input requires `iopt = 1`, and in that !! case all of this input is examined.  a value of zero for any !! of these optional input variables will cause the default value to be !! used.  thus to use a subset of the optional input, simply preload !! locations 5 to 10 in `iwork` to 0, and !! then set those of interest to nonzero values. !! !!  * `iwork(5) = maxord` = the maximum order to be allowed.  the default !!    value is 12 if `meth = 1`, and 5 if `meth = 2`. !!    if `maxord` exceeds the default value, it will !!    be reduced to the default value. !!    if `maxord` is changed during the problem, it may !!    cause the current order to be reduced. !! !!  * `iwork(6) = mxstep` = maximum number of (internally defined) steps !!    allowed during one call to the solver. !!    the default value is 500. !! !!  * `iwork(7) = mxhnil` = maximum number of messages printed (per problem) !!    warning that `t + h = t` on a step (`h` = step size). !!    this must be positive to result in a non-default !!    value.  the default value is 10. !! !! as optional additional output from dvode, the variables listed !! below are quantities related to the performance of dvode !! which are available to the user. !! except where stated otherwise, all of this output is defined !! on any successful return from dvode, and on any return with !! istate = -1, -2, -4, -5, or -6.  on an illegal input return !!
